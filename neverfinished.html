          CAN’T HURT ME, David Goggins’ smash hit memoir, demonstrated how much
          untapped ability we have, but was merely an introduction to the power
          of the mind. In NEVER FINISHED, Goggins takes you inside his Mental
          Lab, where he developed the philosophy, psychology and strategies that
          enabled him to learn that what he thought was his limit was only his
          beginning and that the quest for greatness is unending. The stories
          and lessons in this raw, revealing, unflinching memoir, offer the
          reader a blueprint they can use to climb from the bottom of the barrel
          into a whole new stratosphere that once seemed unattainable. Whether
          you feel off-course in life, are looking to maximize your potential or
          drain your soul to break through your so-called glass ceiling, this is
          the only book you will ever need. In addition to the original edition,
          a curse-word free edition is also available.

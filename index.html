            runner, ultra-distance cyclist, triathlete, public speaker, and
            author. He is a retired United States Navy SEAL member who served in
            the Iraq War. His first memoir, Can't Hurt Me, was released in 2019
            and a sequel Never Finished in 2022.

          <h1><u>Early life</u></h1>
          <p>
            David Goggins was born on February 17, 1975, to Trunnis and Jackie
            Goggins. In 1981, Goggins lived in Williamsville, New York, with his
            parents and brother, Trunnis Jr.[5] Goggins has described how, as a
            six year old, he worked alongside his mother and brother at his
            father's skate rink.[5] Goggins has claimed that he and other
            members of his family suffered constant and severe abuse from his
            alcoholic father before escaping from him along with his mother to
            Brazil, Indiana, something which he talks about in the book Can't
            Hurt Me.[6] In the gap between his discharge from the Air Force and
            enlisting in the Navy, Goggins worked as a pest control fumigator.

            Goggins applied to join the United States Air Force Pararescue, and
            was accepted into training after failing his ASVAB twice. During the
            training he had been diagnosed with sickle cell trait and was
            removed from training. He was given the option to restart the
            training upon his return but chose not to.[7][8] He then completed
            United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) training,
            and worked as a TACP from 1994 until 1999, when he left the United
            States Air Force.[5] After three attempts due to multiple injuries,
            Goggins succeeded in graduating from BUD/S training with BUD/S class
            235 in 2001. Following SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) and
            completion of six month probationary period, he received the NEC
            5326 as a Combatant Swimmer (SEAL), entitled to wear the Special
            Warfare insignia also known as "SEAL Trident". Goggins was assigned
            to SEAL Team 5. In his 20-year military career, Goggins served in
            Iraq and Afghanistan.[9] In 2004, Goggins graduated from Army Ranger
            School, and received the "Enlisted Honor Man" award.

            After several of his friends died in Afghanistan in a helicopter
            crash in 2005 during Operation Red Wings,[10] Goggins began
            long-distance running with the aim of raising money for the Special
            Operations Warrior Foundation. The Foundation gives college
            scholarships and grants to the children of fallen special operations
            soldiers.[11] Competing in endurance challenges, including the
            Badwater Ultramarathon three times, has enabled Goggins to raise
            more than US$2 million for the Special Operations Warrior
            Foundation.

          <p>
            Goggins attempted to enter the Badwater Ultramarathon as a
            fundraiser but was told by organizers that he needed to enter
            another ultramarathon first, as the Badwater is an invitational
            event. In 2005, Goggins entered the San Diego One Day, a 24-hour
            ultramarathon held at Hospitality Point in San Diego. He was able to
            run 101 miles in 19 hours and 6 minutes. He completed the Las Vegas
            Marathon in a time that qualified him for the Boston Marathon. In
            2006, Goggins entered the Hurt-100 in Hawaii. [13] Goggins was
            invited to the 2006 Badwater-135, where he finished 5th overall.[14]
            Three months after completing his first Badwater Ultramarathon in
            2006, he competed in the Ultraman World Championships Triathlon in
            Hawaii. He placed second in the three-day, 320-mile race. He also
            participated in the Furnace Creek-508 (2009),[15] an ultra-distance
            invitational Cycling Race. In 2007, Goggins achieved his best finish
            at the Badwater-135 by placing 3rd overall.[16] He competed in the
            Badwater-135 again in 2008 and did not finish the race.[17] He
            competed in the Badwater-135 in 2013 and finished 18th,[18] after a
            break from the event since 2008.[19] He competed in the Badwater-135
            again in 2014 and did not finish the race.[20] Over the next two
            years,[when?] he competed in another 14 ultra-endurance races, with
            top-five finishes in nine of them. He set a course record at the
            48-hour national championships, beating the previous record by 20
            miles with a total distance traveled of 203.5 miles.[citation
            needed] In 2008 he was named a "Hero of Running" by Runner's
            World.[21] In 2016, Goggins won the Infinitus 88k in 12 hours,
            almost twenty minutes ahead of the next finisher. In the same year,
            he also won the Music City Ultra 50k, and Strolling Jim 40
            Miler.[22] In 2020, Goggins ran the Moab 240 ultramarathon, placing
            2nd in the 241 mile event with a time of 63 hours and 21 minutes,
            approximately 95 minutes behind race winner Michele Graglia.[23][24]
            Entrepreneur Jesse Itzler, upon seeing Goggins perform at a 24-hour
            ultramarathon, called and hired Goggins to live with him in his
            house for a month. Itzler wrote about his experience on a blog and
            later published the story as the book Living With A SEAL.[25] His
            self-help memoir, Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds,
            was released on December 4, 2018. In the book he refers to the 40%
            rule, his belief that most of us only tap into 40% of our
            capabilities.[26] A follow-up sequel Never Finished: Unshackle Your
            Mind and Win the War Within published December 4, 2022, explores the
            principles, understanding of the mind, and methods that allowed
            Goggins to realize his potential and that the pursuit of excellence
            is a never-ending journey.
